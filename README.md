# Super Bernie World

A clone of [Super Bernie World](https://eniko.itch.io/superbernieworld)

You can see the [current version here](https://notnullgames.github.io/bernieworld/).

I love [Super Bernie World](https://eniko.itch.io/superbernieworld), but they use a proprietary game-engine that they cant't release as open-source. For fun, I ported it to [kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/) using their content. All game-content credit goes to [eniko](https://eniko.itch.io/). This makes it so you can edit levels and make new ones!

I had to reverse-enginner the maps a bit, as the object-images weren't included, but maps are now editable in [tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) and loaded with [my plugin](https://github.com/notnullgames/tiled-kaboom). I went through and added differnt properties to make things easier for me to work with, but the goal is to be a perfect clone, but editable.

I also had to convert the font into a uniform format for kaboom.
