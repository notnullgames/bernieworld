# Super Bernie World

I love [Super Bernie World](https://eniko.itch.io/superbernieworld), but they use a proprietary game-engine that they cant't release as open-source. For fun, I ported it to [phaser](https://phaser.io/) using their content. All game-content credit goes to [eniko](https://eniko.itch.io/). This makes it so you can edit levels and make new ones!

I had to reverse-enginner the maps a bit, as the object-images weren't included, but maps are editable in [tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/).
